This file contains the description of how we categorize modules or components into certain categories. 
We refer all the names of the categories from the official website of Apache: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/. 

In the website, it lists eight names of core features and Multi-processing modules. There are modules where they are not belong to any of these core modules. 
We categorise these other modules by considering the functions of the modules described in the official website. 
For example: if the file name kept under this directories: modules/aaa/mod_authn_core.c, we consider this as one of modules relates to authentication. 
Hence, the category name is auth_accs-modules. See file list_of_modules_of_apache.csv.

Hereby the steps of how we categorize the Apache files
1. We extracted the fullname of file path from the new_path field listed in the commits data.
    If the new_path field has no value, we replaced it with the value from the old_path field.

2. We truncate the new_path value. The category should follow the list of names category in the CSV file.
    For example: 
    Fullname of filepath of a file: ‘modules/http/http_core.c’. 
    After it is shortened, the category name is ‘core-modules’
    server/mpm_common.*. The category’s name is ‘mpm_common-server’. 
    For all examples aforementioned, we use the name of the category from the CSV file(list_of_modules_categories_apache.csv).
    The rest of the filepaths that is not listed in the csv file, should be shortened into ‘add-<name-of-the-folder>’. 
    For example: docs should be add-docs
    Put all the shortened filepaths into a separate column called category.
    Save the changes to the separated CSV file.
