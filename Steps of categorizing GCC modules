This file contains the description of how we categorize modules or components into certain categories. 
We refer all of the names of the categories based on a previous work done by Novillo 
(Novillo, Diego. "GCC an architectural overview, current status, and future directions." Proceedings of the linux symposium. Vol. 2. 2006.)
In Novillo's work, he described GCC into three main components: front end, middle end, and back end. Additionally, the source code itselt is organized into three major groups: core, runtime, and support.
Taking these names: front end, middle end, back end, support, runtime into consideration of our category names. 
All the list of the category names can be seen in a file called 'list_of_modules_categories_gcc.csv'

Hereby the steps of how we categorize the GCC files
1. We extracted the fullname of file path from the new_path field listed in the commits data.
    If the new_path field has no value, we replaced it with the value from the old_path field.

2. We truncate the new_path value, the category should follow the list of names category in the CSV file.
    For example: 
    Fullname of filepath: ‘gcc/config/i386/c’. 
    After it is shortened, the category name is ‘back_end_gcc-config
    Special folder – These modules only contain the name of folder. For example, ‘include,’. This folder should be change into ‘shared_module’. Please see the list of the folder and its category in the csv file. 
    The rest of the filepaths that is not listed, should be shortened into ‘add-<name-of-the-folder>-<nake-of-the-subdirectory>’. For example: gcc/rust should be add_gcc-rust
    Put all the shortened filepaths into a separate column called category.
    Save the changes to the separated CSV file.
