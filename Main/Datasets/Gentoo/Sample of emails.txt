Doing this after the command env-update in step 4 
gives me back my keyboard.

GRUB tells me (hd0,11) and after reading the install guide more 
carefully I only can agree!

But after the command root (hd0,11) neither ""find"" nor ""setup"" can 
find stage1 any more.

Could it be a problem that fdisk does not write the partition records 
in disk order? I have split a former linux partition (hda8) in boot and
root 
and left the swap (hda9) and ended up with boot as hda12, root as
hda13,
and swap as hda8.

What version of Gentoo Linux are you installing, and what kind of SCSI card
(and CPU) do you have?

To solve the kemap problem, before you begin you should type:

# loadkeys de-latin1-nodeadkeys

I need to add this to the install guide.

As for the GRUB problem, I think you are specifying the wrong root and boot
partitions.  GRUB's ""root partition"" is our ""boot partition"".

Try this in grub:

grub> find /boot/grub/stage1

GRUB should then tell you what partitions it found stage1 on.  This should
be the partition you specify in the grub ""root"" command.  I hope that helps.

This is the right list to post on... it's where all the developers who can
answer your questions hang out :)

Make sure that your menu.lst file is in the right place.  If you mount your
boot partition at /boot, then the file should be located at
/boot/boot/grub/menu.lst.  The menu.lst file *does* need to be on your boot
partition (hda1), and shouldn't be on your root partition (hda3).
Maybe you created /boot/boot/grub/menu.lst on hda3 by mistake?  Or maybe
you called it menu.""one""st instead of menu.""el""st?

I prefer the second.
Because I didn't contribute anything to GENTOO, and 
don't have powerful skill to help you so much.
As you said, I should wait Daniel's answer when he wake up. :)

Make /etc/pam.d/useradd as follows:
---------------
auth            required    pam_rootok.so
account      required    pam_pwdb.so
session         required    pam_pwdb.so
--------------
copy this to /etc/pam.d/shadow

and things should work better you still get a warning like
useradd: PAM chauthok failed.

I will look into this a little deeper

I think Xx was joking. :P

	At home I use a dual-boot mandrake/win2000 machine and have

There is plenty of other Free Software you could have beenusing.
GNOME and related apps are usually poor examples of good Free
Software. :P  For instance, you could've been using Lout.

You should have regretted buying it.  What if your neighbour wants a
copy of Visio.  Can you legally give him a copy?  It's a well known
fact that no program can ever be known to be bug free, what happens
when you find a crippling bug in Visio?  And don't say they don't
exist, because they do.

You keep saying ``Linux'', and judging from the context, I'm going to

Hmm, boot from the cd, mount your root partition to /mnt/gentoo, chroot there,
cd to /dev and
then type

Or another solution add ""devfs=mount"" to your kernels boot options in the grub
bootmenu. That means you use
the devfs filesystem and devices are generated automatic on demand.
